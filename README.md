This project is a simple application that helps you analyze a webpage to understand its SEO (Search Engine Optimization) status. Here's a straightforward explanation:

### What It Does:
1. **Fetches Webpage**: You enter a URL, and the program fetches the content of that webpage.
2. **Analyzes Content**: It looks at different parts of the webpage like:
   - The title of the page.
   - The description of the page (meta description).
   - The most common words used on the page.
   - Images on the page, checking if they have descriptive text (alt text).
   - Links on the page, checking if any are broken (don't work).

### How It Helps:
- **SEO Insights**: It provides information that can help improve the page's visibility on search engines.
- **Error Detection**: It finds broken links and images without descriptions, which can be fixed to improve user experience and SEO.

### Example:
Imagine you have a webpage for your bakery shop. You want to make sure it's optimized for search engines so people can find your shop easily online. Here's how you use this application:

1. **Enter URL**: You type the URL of your bakery's webpage into the application and click the "Analyze SEO" button.
2. **View Report**:
   - **Title**: The application tells you the title of your page (e.g., "Best Bakery in Town").
   - **Meta Description**: It shows the description (e.g., "We offer the best cakes and pastries in town.").
   - **Common Words**: Lists common words on your page (e.g., "bakery", "cakes", "pastries").
   - **Image Analysis**: It checks all the images on your page to see if they have alt text (descriptions for accessibility).
   - **Link Analysis**: It checks all links to ensure they are working and not broken.

3. **Save Report**: You can save this analysis as a text file to review later or share with your web developer.

### Benefits:
- **Improve SEO**: Helps you understand what to improve for better search engine ranking.
- **Fix Errors**: Identifies broken links and missing image descriptions to enhance user experience.
